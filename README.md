We made a small application based on person’s requirement and remember the slogan of each and every people “Make India Digital” so if we think for the digitalization so we have to make each and every small and big thing digitalized so if every person thinks that and gave their efforts and  hard works  in particular field then we definitely achieve our Aim. So we make a one digitalized online Application that is E-Health Card. This application is very useful in medical life.
What is E-Health card?
A Health Card is like an identity card, which identifies you as the person who has been insured by your health insurance company. Your health card provides you access to the network hospitals and your selected doctors for your treatment.  The benefit of holding a health card is that it allows you to avail cashless treatment in network hospitals.
In our project we exactly worked on the digital system. So it reduces the book/pen work and gives you to work on digital process.
Because till now peoples of medical staff use pen /paper work and they keep records in that also.but due to these online digitalized facilities this will reduce the work of odd technique.
Yeah, this is new for uneducated people and even some peoples are also unaware about it. but we have to publicity the peoples about the digitalization and importance of health card.  
How E-Health card works?
The E-Health Card is a digital tool embedded in a smartphone or tablet to assist providers during the care process. It works on the specified no. given by government to the users and according to that, number is given by admin or person who is accessing your Health Card system to login into your system and after once login he/she can check your details.
Comparison between E-health card with non E-health card system (no e- health card was there)
When there is no E-Health card facility available at that time the patients have to faces many problems.
At that time if patient had an appointment with doctor than he/she has to take the appointment before 1-2 days and confirmed it.
And now due to this system just patient had to check his/her card for next appointment. 
When there is no e-health card facility available, that time patient has to keep his/her records given by doctor in file, if that file is missing or he/she don’t know where he/she kept that file than again he/she had to describe his/her problem to doctor.
With the use of this card the records are saved in the card, so if the file is missing then also you know the prescription from your card and many more details you can know from this card.
